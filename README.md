*Hello to all friends of Data and Machine.*

I am Abbas Baramaki and I am interested in solving various challenges in the field of science data.
Therefore, I decided to select some interesting and useful datasets from the https://kaggle.com site and apply various methods of analysis, preprocessing, modeling and evaluation to them.
Then they put their results and code in a special repository on GitHub for others to use or share their comments with me.
This repository will include solving problems of prediction, classification, clustering, text analysis, etc.
I try to solve at least one data every day and explain it comprehensively and comprehensibly. I hope this repository is useful and interesting for you.
